Project Description:

The goal of this project is to design and implement a comprehensive data solution using SQL Server, SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services), and Power BI. The project aims to create a Data Warehouse (DW) and utilize Power BI for data visualization and reporting.

Key Components:

SQL Server: The project will leverage the power and reliability of SQL Server as the database management system. SQL Server provides a robust platform for storing and managing large volumes of data efficiently. It offers various features like high availability, security, and scalability.

SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services): SSIS will be utilized to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from various data sources into the Data Warehouse. SSIS provides a visual development environment for building ETL processes and offers a wide range of transformations and connectivity options to handle diverse data sources.

Data Warehouse (DW): The project will involve designing and implementing a Data Warehouse to provide a unified, integrated, and optimized repository of data for analysis and reporting. The DW will be designed to support efficient querying and reporting by organizing data into a dimensional model such as star or snowflake schema.

Power BI: Power BI will be employed as the primary tool for data visualization, interactive dashboards, and reporting. Power BI allows users to create visually appealing and interactive reports, enabling stakeholders to gain valuable insights from the data stored in the Data Warehouse. The integration with SQL Server and other data sources will enable real-time or near-real-time reporting.
